# My Atomberg scripts
These scripts are for windows, but you can easily change them to be used for Linux

### Documentation
All documentations can be found here: https://developer.atomberg-iot.com

### get access token.bat
This give you your access token, which you need to use commands.

### Atomberg Fan AFK.bat
Gets new access token, turns fan off, waits for user activity then turns fan on. Useful if you go afk.

(_Only issue with this is, it gets new access token everytime which kinda wastes api calls, but there's 100/day limit, and I don't dont go afk more than 5 times a day._)
